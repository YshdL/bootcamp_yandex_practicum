### Conclusion
Marital status shows a modest 2% impact on timely loan repayment, with married, previously married, and widowed clients being slightly more cautious. Customers without children and those with three children exhibit favourable repayment behaviour. Loan purposes also affect repayment, with real estate and wedding loans having lower default rates. Income categories 'bad' and 'good' perform better, while 'very bad' perform less favourably. Analyzing delinquency duration and loan issuance timing is essential for a comprehensive scoring model.
